scope images: starting at sds000001

- sds000001.png is the taping of XY where yellow is the y and x is on red. channel 2. 


well actually since the way my USB is setup. the first image will be sds0000006.

measuring XY on channel 1 and channel 2 
	max is 2.80 and 2.74 volts 
	min is 1.96 and 1.92
	I tapped the holder pretty hard. 
	
	
	I want to do some persistence to see what the high's and lows could be while moving the device. also should monitor Z
	

sds0000007
	did a peak detection on the signal. its quite noisy! yellow is the z
	a slow motion of taking an object resulted in no large peak. 
	

sds0000008	
	did a simulated movement of device as if i was walking? maybe but still not very noticible. 
	maximum and minimum had about 850mV difference. 
	the average motion in the y direction was bigger (purple channel 2).
	
	
sds0000009
	simulated big motions in Z and got a much larger swing. 
	doing peak to peak measure its probably better.
	
sds00000011 
	peak to peak on both ch1 and ch2
	simulating picking up an object. with a horizontal scale of 500ms. so over a half a second measurement period?
	
	maybe it would be easier to do the average value and then if the value changes over a period of time longer than a few seconds
	

so a threshold in time and in accelerometer data. 


image 12
	did a long measurement period 5seconds per division. so i could see Y and Z 
	got a peak to peak of about 2 volts for both channels at its max. 
	
image 13. completely still 
	i can see some high frequency spikes
	these can be removed with averaging. which is shown at a 100ms per division 
	500mv
	the peak to peak is 120mV! so averaging is a good way to go. 128 averages at 100ms 
	
	
	
	image 14
now with less insane movement. as if i wasn't running but if i was holding the device steady myself. 
1 second per division 

image15
	 averaging over 1024 samples with 500ms per division steady no stimulation
	 we had 180mV peak to peak both channels so looks like many averages are required. 

	 
since the screen is 7 seconds wide at 500mS per div (14 squares) maybe a period of 7 seconds is a good way to define movement. 

image16:
	movement over same horizontal scale. 
	YZ measures. 
	slight movement. looks like 600mV on Y
	
image17 about 1.5V difference on both channels slight movement
	same horizontal scale

image 18
	with a pick up of object
	and trying to hold steady
	got 1.3 V changes
	

image 19
with digitalWrite I got a frequency of 133kHz 

image 20
trying to use delay (1) and port writes.
I don't think i'm addressing the correct pin!

def not addressing correct pin. but it is portD
i also was facing brown out! or similar

I have quite large voltage spikes. I turned up the current limit and the device doesn't reset. how did I know it was resetting?

image 22 is what it looks like. 
reset of about 300mS

Maybe I am just not correctly flipping bits!
I did PORTD = 0x0F; 
and PORT = 0x00; 
to force the bit to change. 
this is image 12. we have a frequency of 2.67 Mhz

so with 0b00000100 //bit 2
that worked to turn on the led. and the fastest is 2.67 Mhz... not very fast for a 16Mhz device.... bootloader is burned though. 


I think now we have a good idea of what the thresholds might be around. 

if we do an average over 1 second 

I am having a hard time measuring the loop time with a bit flip. 


Lets take some more measruemnts:
z is at 2.32 
y is at 1.62v

so lets focus on Z 2.32V

2.32/3.3V *1024 is 719 or so. 
if we had 200 mV range then thats 62 adc points.

lets do a blink with millis
