stuff i need to do for my project:

1) test the sleep interrupt wake up with the magnetic switch
	ie activate a scheme to take measurments and wake up with WDT
2) change mode with mag switch	
	while mag switch in place, be sleeping
	oh! ok WDT on longest possible on sleeping
	or sleeping and on change of magnetic
		then go into another mode that uses ADC for accl data collection
3) if mag replaced and alarm did not tirgger
	go back into deep sleep
	and check magnet at very veyr long periods
	
4) if magnet removed
	and adc finds a difference
	sound alarm!
	and use NRF to burst out radio signal
